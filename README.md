Instructions:<br>
1. Download archived file to your local directory.
2. Extract the downloaded file.

Note:<br>
This manual is written mostly in Japanese, therefore I would recommend to use something like "DeepL translator for free" at https://www.deepl.com/translator , みんなの自動翻訳＠TexTra at https://mt-auto-minhon-mlt.ucri.jgn-x.jp/ or Google Translation when you read in another language.
