Dear readers,

This directory contains text data about Fedora.us; the old community project, which was known as "Fedora Linux" The initial project was started by Warren Togami who was then a student of computer science at Hawaii University.

I translated the then website, granted permission personally from Warren, as it seemed very useful for many Linux users in Japan. So, translated pages were made public since then.

Today, they are out-dated, but it is seemed to us that their records are historically important. Therefore I preserved them hereby. You can still find the old Fedora.us website at internet archive - https://web.archive.org/web/20050515023629/http://www.fedora.us/ .
