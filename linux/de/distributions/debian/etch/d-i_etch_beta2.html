<h2 id="content_1_0">Debian Installer etch beta 2</h2>
<p>March 15th, 2006</p>
<p>The Debian Installer team is proud to announce the second beta
release of the installer for Debian GNU/Linux Etch.</p>
<p>Improvements in this release of the installer include:</p>
<ul class="list1" style="padding-left: 16px; margin-left: 16px;">
  <li>base-config
has been pensioned off: the installation is now done entirely before
the reboot. Finally the entire Debian package installation process runs
behind a user-friendly progress bar.</li>
  <li>This new version of the installer uses and installs the 2.6.15
kernel. As a consequence the installer now uses udev instead of
discover for hardware detection for 2.6 based installs and supports the
initramfs-tools and yaird initrd generators.</li>
  <li>Installations on S/390 are again supported.</li>
  <li>In addition to the architectures that had already made the
switch,
2.6 is now the default kernel for alpha, ia64 and Netwinder/CATS (arm).</li>
  <li>The installer will set up /etc/apt/sources.list for the installed
system using the codename (etch) rather than the suite (testing) of the
release being installed.</li>
  <li>The installed system is set up to use UTF-8 encoding by default.</li>
  <li>For some architectures it is now possible to automatically
partition a disk using logical volume management (LVM). Other
architectures are expected to be added later.</li>
  <li>Automatically selects gpt disklabel instead of msdos disklabel
for disks larger than 2 TB.</li>
  <li>Option to cancel some operations (e.g. DHCP configuration).</li>
  <li>Initial support for Broadcom BCM947XX and Linksys NSLU2 added.</li>
  <li>Improved rescue mode.</li>
  <li>Added the following languages: Icelandic and Kazakh.</li>
</ul>
<p>This release no longer supports the following:</p>
<ul class="list1" style="padding-left: 16px; margin-left: 16px;">
  <li>Preseeding
of base-config/early_command and base-config/late_command was removed
with base-config. Existing preseed files using those values should be
adapted to use preseed/late_command instead.</li>
  <li>This release has limited localization of the installed system as
the package localization-config (which was responsible for part of
that) has not yet been adapted so it can be run before the reboot.</li>
  <li>Installing Sarge is not supported; we expect to support this
again in the next release.</li>
  <li>sparc32: No support for installations using a 2.6 kernel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to everybody who has contributed to this release. Special
thanks go out to our friends from Ubuntu who laid the ground work for
the first two improvements mentioned above.</p>
<p>The graphical installer is not part of this release although
significant progress has been made in its development. We expect to
integrate it into the next beta release of the installer. Images are
available for testing from our website.</p>
<p>Installation CDs, other media, and everything else you'll need are
available from our web site.<br>
