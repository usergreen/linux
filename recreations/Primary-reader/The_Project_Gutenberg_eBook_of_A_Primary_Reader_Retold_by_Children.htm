<h1>A PRIMARY READER</h1>

<h2>Old-time Stories, Fairy Tales and Myths Retold by Children</h2>

<h2>E. LOUISE SMYTHE</h2>


<br>

<br>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>
This book originated in a series of little reading lessons prepared
for the first grade pupils in the Santa Rosa public schools. The
object of the lessons was three-fold: to provide reading matter for
the little ones who had only a small vocabulary of sight-words; to
acquaint them early with the heroes who have come down to us in song
and story; and to create a desire for literature.
</p>

<p>
It has been my endeavor to follow Dr. G. Stanley Hall's suggestions in
his monograph, "How to Teach Reading," where he asks for "true
child-editions, made by testing many children with the work piece-meal
and cutting and adapting the material till it really and closely
fitted the minds and hearts of the children."
</p>

<p>
Various stories were given to the pupils; discussions followed. After
a time the story was produced orally by the children. Notes were made
on expressions used and points of interest dwelt upon. Later the story
was either written on the blackboard or mimeographed and put into the
pupils' hands to read.
</p>

<p>
It gave great delight to the children to recognize an old friend in a
new dress, and as interest was aroused, but little difficulty was
encountered in recognizing words that were indeed "new" in their sight
vocabulary, but old servants in their oral vocabulary.
</p>

<p>
The spirit of the book may be illustrated by referring to the roast
turkey in the story of The Little Match Girl. The story was told as
dear old Hans Christian Andersen gave it to the little German children
of fifty years ago. But American children have a different idea of the
fowl which graces the table at Christmas time. The story as it came
from the lips of the children referred to the "turkey," and "goose"
was used in only one instance. As the story was to appeal to our
children, the word was changed to suit their ideas.
</p>

<p>
Again, in the story of Red Riding-Hood we preferred to use the German
ending, as it leaves a far happier impression on the minds of the
children than the accepted English version. The incongruity of the
wolf's swallowing whole the grandmother and child does not destroy the
child's enjoyment of the story, while the happy release of both
grandmother and little girl forms a suitable close.
</p>

<p>
Also, as this old story handed down in so many languages is an
interpretation of one of the Sun myths, it seems better to cling to
the original, especially when it meets so entirely with the child's
approval.
</p>

<p>
Before presenting the Norse myths for reading, they had been the
subject of many conversations, queries and illustrations. Some were
even dramatized--in a childlike way, of course. Detailed descriptions
of Mt. Ida, Asgard, and some of the principal heroes, were given. But,
though the little audience seemed interested in the introductory
remarks, these never came back when the children were called upon to
reproduce the story. The narrator at once plunged into the story part.
It is for this reason descriptions of heroes and places have been
omitted in these stories. It is thus left for each teacher who uses
this book to employ her own method of introducing the gods of the
hardy Norseman to her pupils.
</p>

<p>
The following works will be found useful and quite available to most
teachers: Andersen's Norse Mythology, Mabie's Norse Stories, Mara
Pratt's Stories from Norseland, Fiske's Myths and Myth Makers,
Taylor's Primitive Culture, Vol. I.; and Longfellow's Poems.
</p>

<p>
Hoping these stories will interest other children as they have
interested those who helped build them, I send them forth.

<p>
A duck made her nest under some leaves.
</p>

<p class="ctr">

</p>

<p>
She sat on the eggs to keep them warm.
</p>

<p>
At last the eggs broke, one after the other. Little ducks came out.
</p>

<p>
Only one egg was left. It was a very large one.
</p>

<p>
At last it broke, and out came a big, ugly duckling.
</p>

<p>
"What a big duckling!" said the old duck. "He does not look like
us. Can he be a turkey?--We will see. If he does not like the water,
he is not a duck."
</p>



<table summary="stories" width="50%" cellpadding="10" border="1" align="center">

</tbody></table>

<p>
The next day the mother duck took her ducklings to the pond.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7841/7841-h/images/009.png"><img src="The_Project_Gutenberg_eBook_of_A_Primary_Reader_Retold_by_Children_files/009th.png" alt="THE DUCK TAKES HER DUCKLINGS TO SWIM"></a>
</p>

<p>
Splash! Splash! The mother duck was in the water. Then she called
the ducklings to come in. They all jumped in and began to swim. The
big, ugly duckling swam, too.
</p>

<p>
The mother duck said, "He is not a turkey. He is my own little duck.
He will not be so ugly when he is bigger."
</p>



<table summary="stories" width="50%" cellpadding="10" border="1" align="center">

</tbody></table>

<p>
Then she said to the ducklings, "Come with me. I want you to see the
other ducks. Stay by me and look out for the cat."
</p>

<p>
They all went into the duck yard. What a noise the ducks made!
</p>

<p>
While the mother duck was eating a big bug, an old duck bit the ugly
duckling.
</p>

<p>
"Let him alone," said the mother duck. "He did not hurt you."
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7841/7841-h/images/011.png"><img src="The_Project_Gutenberg_eBook_of_A_Primary_Reader_Retold_by_Children_files/011th.png" alt="'HE DID NOT HURT YOU,' SAID THE MOTHER DUCK"></a>
</p>

<p>
"I know that," said the duck, "but he is so ugly, I bit him."
</p>



<table summary="stories" width="50%" cellpadding="10" border="1" align="center">
<tbody><tr><td width="33%">lovely</td><td width="33%">help</td><td width="33%">there</td></tr>
<tr><td width="33%">walked</td><td width="33%">bushes</td><td width="33%">afraid</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
The next duck they met, said, "You have lovely ducklings. They
are all pretty but one. He is very ugly."
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7841/7841-h/images/012.png"><img src="The_Project_Gutenberg_eBook_of_A_Primary_Reader_Retold_by_Children_files/012th.png" alt="'YOUR CHILDREN ARE ALL PRETTY EXCEPT ONE.'"></a>
</p>

<p>
The mother duck said, "I know he is not pretty. But he is very good."
</p>

<p>
Then she said to the ducklings, "Now, my dears, have a good time."
</p>

<p>
But the poor, big, ugly duckling did not have a good time.
</p>

<p>
The hens all bit him. The big ducks walked on him.
</p>

<p>
The poor duckling was very sad. He did not want to be so ugly. But
he could not help it.
</p>

<p>
He ran to hide under some bushes. The little birds in the bushes were
afraid and flew away.
</p>



<table summary="stories" width="50%" cellpadding="10" border="1" align="center">

</tbody></table>

<p>
"It is all because I am so ugly," said the duckling. So he ran away.
</p>

<p>
At night he came to an old house. The house looked as if it would fall
down. It was so old. But the wind blew so hard that the duckling went
into the house.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7841/7841-h/images/014.png"><img src="The_Project_Gutenberg_eBook_of_A_Primary_Reader_Retold_by_Children_files/014th.png" alt="THE UGLY DUCKLING FINDS THE OLD HOUSE"></a>
</p>

<p>
An old woman lived there with her cat and her hen.
</p>

<p>
The old woman said, "I will keep the duck. I will have some eggs."
</p>



<table summary="stories" width="50%" cellpadding="10" border="1" align="center">
<tbody><tr><td width="33%">growl</td><td width="33%">walk</td></tr>
<tr><td width="33%">corner</td><td width="33%">animals</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
The next day, the cat saw the duckling and began to growl.
</p>

<p>
The hen said, "Can you lay eggs?" The duckling said, "No."
</p>

<p>
"Then keep still," said the hen. The cat said, "Can you growl?"
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7841/7841-h/images/015.png"><img src="The_Project_Gutenberg_eBook_of_A_Primary_Reader_Retold_by_Children_files/015th.png" alt="THE CAT SAID, 'CAN YOU GROWL?'"></a>
</p>

<p>
"No," said the duckling.
</p>

<p>
"Then keep still," said the cat.
</p>

<p>
And the duckling hid in a corner. The next day he went for a walk. He
saw a big pond. He said, "I will have a good swim."
</p>

<p>
But all of the animals made fun of him. He was so ugly.
</p>



<table summary="stories" width="50%" cellpadding="10" border="1" align="center">

</tbody></table>

<p>
The summer went by.
</p>

<p>
Then the leaves fell and it was very cold. The poor duckling had a
hard time.
</p>

<p>
It is too sad to tell what he did all winter.
</p>

<p>
At last it was spring.
</p>

<p>
The birds sang. The ugly duckling was big now.
</p>

<p>
One day he flew far away.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7841/7841-h/images/017.png"><img src="The_Project_Gutenberg_eBook_of_A_Primary_Reader_Retold_by_Children_files/017th.png" alt="'OH, SEE THE LOVELY SWAN!'"></a>
</p>

<p>
Soon he saw three white swans on the lake.
</p>

<p>
He said, "I am going to see those birds. I am afraid they will kill
me, for I am so ugly."
</p>

<p>
He put his head down to the water. What did he see? He saw himself in
the water. But he was not an ugly duck. He was a white swan.
</p>

<p>
The other swans came to see him.
</p>

<p>
The children said, "Oh, see the lovely swans. The one that came last
is the best."
</p>

<p>
And they gave him bread and cake.
</p>

<p>
It was a happy time for the ugly duckling.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="ii">THE LITTLE PINE TREE</a></h2>

</tbody></table>

<p>
A little pine tree was in the woods.
</p>

<p>
It had no leaves. It had needles.
</p>

<p>
The little tree said, "I do not like needles. All the other trees in
the woods have pretty leaves. I want leaves, too. But I will have
better leaves. I want gold leaves."
</p>

<p>
Night came and the little tree went to sleep. A fairy came by and gave
it gold leaves.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7841/7841-h/images/020.png"><img src="The_Project_Gutenberg_eBook_of_A_Primary_Reader_Retold_by_Children_files/020th.png" alt="THE FAIRY GIVES THE PINK TREE GOLD LEAVES"></a>

</tbody></table>

<p>
When the little tree woke it had leaves of gold.
</p>

<p>
It said, "Oh, I am so pretty! No other tree has gold leaves."
</p>

<p>
Night came.
</p>

<p>
A man came by with a bag. He saw the gold leaves. He took them all and
put them into his bag.
</p>

<p>
The poor little tree cried, "I do not want gold leaves again. I will
have glass leaves."
</p>



<table summary="stories" width="50%" cellpadding="10" border="1" align="center">

<tr><td width="33%">looked</td><td width="33%">wind</td><td width="33%">blew</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
So the little tree went to sleep. The fairy came by and put the glass
leaves on it.
</p>

<p>
The little tree woke and saw its glass leaves.
</p>

<p>
How pretty they looked in the sunshine! 'No other tree was so bright.
</p>

<p>
Then a wind came up. It blew and blew.
</p>

<p>
The glass leaves all fell from the tree and were broken.
</p>



<table summary="stories" width="50%" cellpadding="10" border="1" align="center">
<tbody><tr><td width="33%">again</td><td width="33%">green</td></tr>
<tr><td width="33%">goat</td><td width="33%">hungry</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Again the little tree had no leaves. It was very sad, and said, "I
will not have gold leaves and I will not have glass leaves. I want
green leaves. I want to be like the other trees."
</p>

<p>
And the little tree went to sleep. When it woke, it was like other
trees. It had green leaves.
</p>

<p>
A goat came by. He saw the green leaves on the little tree. The
goat was hungry and he ate all the leaves.
</p>

<p>
Then the little tree said, "I do not want any leaves. I will not
have green leaves, nor glass leaves, nor gold leaves. I like my
needles best."

</p>

<p>
And the little tree went to sleep. The fairy gave it what it wanted.
</p>

<p>
When it woke, it had its needles again. Then the little pine tree
was happy.

</tbody></table>

<p>
It was very cold. The snow fell and it was almost dark.
</p>

<p>
It was the last day of the year.
</p>

<p>
A little match girl was running in the street. Her name was Gretchen.
She had no hat on.
</p>

<p>
Her feet were bare. When she left home, she had on some big slippers
of her mama's. But they were so large that she lost them when she ran
across the street.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen had a lot of matches in her old apron.
</p>

<p>
She had a little bunch in her hand.
</p>

<p>
But she could not sell her matches. No one would buy them.
</p>

<p>
Poor little Gretchen!
</p>

<p>
She was cold and hungry.
</p>

<p>
The snow fell on her curly hair. But she did not think about that.
</p>

<p>
She saw lights in the houses.
</p>

<p>
She smelled good things cooking.
</p>

<p>
She said to herself, "This is the last night of the year."

<p>
Gretchen got colder and colder.
</p>

<p>
She was afraid to go home. She knew her papa would whip her, if she
did not take some money to him.
</p>

<p>
It was as cold at home as in the street. They were too poor to have
a fire. They had to put rags in the windows to keep out the wind.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen did not even have a bed. She had to sleep on a pile of rags.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Her little hands were almost frozen.
</p>

<p>
She took a match and lighted it to warm her hands. The match looked
like a little candle.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen thought she was sitting by a big stove. It was so bright.
</p>

<p>
She put the match near her feet, to warm them. Then the light went
out. She did not think that she was by the stove any more.

<p>
Gretchen lighted another match.
</p>

<p>
Now she thought she could look into a room. In this room was a table.
</p>

<p>
A white cloth and pretty dishes were on the table. There was a roast
turkey, too. It was cooked and ready to eat. The knife and fork were
in his back. The turkey jumped from the dish and ran to the little
girl.
</p>

<p>
The light went out and she was in the cold and dark again.

a Christmas tree. Very many candles were on the tree. It was full
of pretty things.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen put up her little hands. The light went out.
</p>

<p>
The lights on the Christmas tree went up, up--until she saw they
were the stars.

"Some one is dying," said little Gretchen.

<p>
Her grandma had been very good to the little girl. But she was dead.
</p>

<p>
The grandma had said, "When a star falls some one is going to God."
</p>

<p>
The little girl lighted another match. It made a big light.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen thought she saw her grandma. She never looked so pretty
before. She looked so sweet and happy.

you will go away. The stove and the turkey and the Christmas tree all
went away."

<p>
Then Gretchen lighted a bunch of matches. She wanted to keep her
grandma with her. The matches made it very light.

The grandma took the little girl in her arms. They went up, up--where
they would never be cold or hungry.

They were with God.

In her hand were the burned matches.

They said, "Poor little thing, she froze to death."

They did not know how happy she was in heaven.

Once upon a time three of the gods went on a journey.

One was Thor and one was Loki. Loki was ugly and mean.

<p>
The gods liked to walk over the hills and rocks. They could go very
fast for they were so big.

The gods walked on and on.

At last they got very hungry. Then they came to a field with cattle.

Some one said, "Give me my share, and I will make the meat cook."

The gods looked to see who was talking. There in an oak tree was a big
eagle.

This made Loki cross for he was very hungry. He took a long pole
to hit the eagle. But the pole stuck to the eagle's claws. The other
end stuck to Loki.
</p>

<p>
Then the eagle flew away. He did not fly high. He flew just high
enough for Loki to hit against the stones.

In this city Idun kept the beautiful golden apples. When the gods
felt they were growing old, they ate the apples and were young again.

Loki said, "Come with me and I will show them to you. It is only a
little way. Bring your apples with you."

As soon as Idun was out of the gates the eagle flew down. He picked

So they made fires on the walls. At last Loki flew over the walls.

see what we can do."
</p>

<p>
Sindre wanted to know what the wonderful things were.
</p>

<p>
Brok said, "Loki has a golden crown that will grow like real hair. A
ship that can go anywhere. A spear that never misses the mark."
</p>

<p>
"We will show him," said the dwarfs.

<p>
The dwarfs soon had the fires burning. Then Sindre put a pigskin into
the fire.
</p>

<p>
He gave the bellows to Brok and said, "Now blow as hard as you can."
</p>

<p>
Then Sindre went out. Brok blew and blew.
</p>

<p>
A little fly came in and bit him on the hand.
</p>

<p>
The fly bit him so hard that Brok thought he would have to stop
blowing, but he did not.
</p>

<p>
Then Sindre came back. He took out a golden pig from the fire.

He said to Brok, "Blow and blow and blow, and do not stop."

Then Sindre went out again.
</p>

<p>
So Brok blew as hard as he could.
</p>

<p>
Then the same fly came in and bit him again.
</p>

<p>
Brok thought that he could not stand it, but he kept on.
</p>

<p>
When Sindre came back, he took a gold ring from the fire.

He said to Brok, "Now blow as hard as you can."

<p>
And Sindre went out. Brok blew and blew. The same mean fly came again,
and bit him on the forehead. It bit so hard that the blood ran into
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Brok put up his hand to brush away the fly.
</p>

<p>
Just then Sindre came back.
</p>

<p>
He took the hammer out of the fire.

<p>
Brok hurried up to Asgard with his things.
</p>

<p>
All the gods came around to see. Then Loki came up to show his things.
</p>

<p>
He put the crown of gold on Sif's head and it began to grow like real
hair.

<p>
He gave the spear to Odin and said, "This spear will never miss its

<p>
Then he took out the ship. He said, "This is a wonderful ship. It will
sail on any sea, and yet you can fold it up and put it into your

Loki felt very proud, for he thought his things were the best.

Brok took out the gold ring. He said, "Each night this ring will
throw off a ring just like it. He gave the ring to Odin."
</p>

<p>
Then Brok took out the golden pig. He said, "This pig can go anywhere,
on the ground or in the air. It can go faster than any horse. If the
night is dark, the shining pig will make it light."

<p>
Then Brok showed the hammer. He said, "This is not a very pretty
hammer. When I was making it, Loki turned himself into a fly and made
me spoil it. The fly bit me so hard that I had to stop blowing. So the
handle is a little short. But it is a wonderful hammer. If you throw
it at anything, it will hit the mark and come back to you."
</p>

<p>
The gods picked up the hammer and passed it around.
</p>

<p>
They said, "It will be just the things with which to keep the Frost
Giants out of Asgard."

Brok gave the hammer to Thor. That is the way Thor got his wonderful
hammer.

<p>
Then Brok said to Loki, "You said I could have your head if my things
were the best."
</p>

<p>
And Loki was angry and said, "Yes, I told you that you could have my
head. But you can't touch my neck."

<p>
Of course, Brok could not get his head without touching his neck.

So Brok did not get Loki's head.

The Frost Giants did not like the sunshine. They did not like to see
the flowers. They did not like to hear the birds sing. They wanted to
spoil everything.
</p>

<p>
The Frost Giants wanted to get into Asgard. But they did not know how.
They were afraid of Thor and his hammer. They said, "If we can only
get the hammer, we can get into Asgard."
</p>

<p>
They talked and planned all night. At last one Frost Giant said, "I
know how we can get the hammer. I will dress in a bird suit. Then I
will fly up to Thor's house and get the hammer."

The next night the Frost Giant flew into the house while Thor was

<p>
He took the hammer and flew away with it.
</p>

<p>
When Thor woke, he put out his hand to get the hammer. It was gone.

<p>
When Loki came to the city of the Frost Giants, he took off the falcon
suit. He walked and walked until he came to Thrym's house. Thrym was
the giant who took the hammer.

Thrym was sitting on the porch, making gold collars for his dogs.
</p>

<p>
When he saw Loki, he said, "What do you want?"
</p>

<p>
Loki said, "I have come for the hammer."
</p>

<p>
The old giant laughed and said, "You will never get that hammer. It is
buried eight miles deep in the ground.

<p>
"But there is one way you can get it. I will give you the hammer if
you get Freyja for my wife."

Freyja said, "Do you think I will be the Frost Giant's wife? I won't
be his wife."

Thor said, "We can get the hammer back if you will."

But Freyja said, "No, I will not be his wife."

<p>
Loki said, "You will have to, if we get the hammer back."

Still Freyja said, "I will not go." And she was very angry. She shook
so hard that she broke her necklace and it fell to the floor.

They said, "Well, that is the only way we can get the hammer back."
</p>

<p>
Thor said, "I do not like to dress like a girl, but I will do it."
Then they dressed Thor up like Freyja.
</p>

<p>
They put on Freyja's dress, necklace and vail, and braided his hair.
</p>

Loki said, "I will dress up too, and be your servant."

They got into Thor's goat wagon and went to the Giants' home.

So Thor got his hammer back.

<p>
Long, long ago there lived a king in Greece. He had two little
children, a boy and a girl.
</p>

<p>
They were good children and loved each other very much.
</p>

<p>
One day they were playing in the garden.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Helle, look!" said the boy.
</p>

<p>
There on the grass was a fine large sheep. This sheep had a fleece of
gold and his horns were gold, too.

<p>
The children wanted to pat the sheep, but they could not catch him.
When they went near, he ran away on the clouds.

<p>
Every day they played in the garden and every day the sheep came, too.
</p>

<p>
By and by he grew tame and let the children pat his golden fleece.
</p>

<p>
One day the boy said, "Helle, let us take a ride."
</p>

<p>
First he helped his sister on the sheep's back.
</p>

<p>
Then he got on and held to the horns.
</p>

<p>
"Hold tight to me, Helle," he said.

<p>
The sheep went up, up into the sky, and ran a long way on the clouds.
But Helle got dizzy and fell down into the sea.
</p>

<p>
The boy felt very bad to lose his sister, but went right on.
</p>

<p>
Then he came to the land Colchis. He killed the sheep and gave the
golden fleece to the king.

<p>
By the tree was a dragon. The dragon never went to sleep. He would not
let any one but the king come to the tree.

Jason was a brave young man. He lived a little way from the king's
city.
</p>

<p>
One day the king gave a big party and invited Jason.
</p>

<p>
It was a very dark night and it rained hard.
</p>

<p>
Jason had to go across a creek, but there was no bridge.

<p>
The creek was full of water and Jason had to wade.
</p>

<p>
One of his shoe-strings came untied and he lost his shoe in the
water.

<p>
When he came to the king's house, he had but one shoe.

<p>
The king did not like this, for a fairy had said, "The man who shall
come to your house with one shoe, will be king."
</p>

<p>
So he knew Jason was to be king.

Then he said to Jason, "You may be king when you bring me the golden
fleece."
</p>

<p>
Jason was glad to go, and asked many brave men to go with him.
</p>

<p>
To get the golden fleece they would have to fight wild men and
animals.
</p>

<p>
They made a big ship which they named "Argo."
</p>

<p>
The men who went on the Argo were called Argonauts.

The ship Argo sailed a long way. There were two strong men on the

<p>
One day the Argo came to a land where the blind king lived.
</p>

<p>
This poor king had a hard time. When he sat down to the table to eat,
some ugly birds called Harpies, came too. The Harpies had skin like
brass and nobody could hurt them. They had claws of iron, and
scratched people when they tried to drive them away.
</p>

<p>
When the king's dinner was ready, the Harpies came and took it away.
When Jason and his men came, the king told them all about it. Jason
said they would help him.

<p>
They all sat down to the table. When the food was put on the table,
the Harpies came flying in. Jason and his men took their swords.

</p>

<p>
They cut at the Harpies but could not hurt them.
</p>

<p>
Then the two men with wings flew up in the air. The Harpies were
afraid and flew away. The men flew after them.
</p>

<p>
At last the Harpies grew very tired and fell into the sea and were
drowned.
</p>

<p>
Then the men with wings came back.
</p>

<p>
Now the blind king could eat all he wanted.

<p>
It was now time for Jason and his friends to go away.
</p>

<p>
The king thanked them over and over again for helping him.
</p>

<p>
When they said good-bye, he told them how to get to the land where
they would find the golden fleece.
</p>

<p>
On the sea where Jason and his men had to sail, were two big rocks.
These rocks moved on the waterlike icebergs.
</p>

<p>
They were as high as a big hill. They would come close to each other,
then they would go far apart.
</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>
When fishes swam in the water the rocks would come together and kill
the fishes.
</p>

<p>
If birds flew in the air, the rocks would come together and kill
birds.
</p>

<p>
If a boat sailed on the water, the rocks would come together and break
the boat into little pieces.
</p>

<p>
These rocks had been put in the sea, so no one could go to the land
where the golden fleece was.
</p>

<p>
When the ship Argo came to the rocks, Jason sent a dove out.
</p>

<p>
The rocks came together when the dove was almost past.
</p>

<p>
Then they went far apart. Jason made his men row as hard as they
could.
</p>

<p>
The rocks began to come together. "Row hard, my men," said Jason.
</p>

<p>
Just as they got past, the rocks hit, but Jason and his men were all
right.
</p>

<p>
So they came to Colchis.
<br>

<p>
When Jason came to Colchis, he went to the king and said, "Will you
give me the golden fleece?"
</p>

<p>
The king wanted to keep the fleece.
</p>

<p>
So he said to Jason, "You may have it, but you must do something
for me first."
</p>

<p>
"You must plow with the brass bulls, and plant the dragon's teeth."
</p>

<p>
The brass bulls looked like real bulls, but they were larger and
stronger.
</p>

<p>
They blew out fire and smoke from their noses and mouths.
</p>

<p>
The bulls had a stall made of iron and stone. They had to be tied
with strong iron chains.
</p>

<p>
When the dragon's teeth were planted, iron men grew up.
</p>

<p>
They always killed the one who had planted them.
</p>

<p>
The king wanted the bulls to kill Jason.
</p>

</p>

<p>
He said, "If the bulls do not kill him the iron men will."
</p>

<p>
The king had a daughter named Medea. She saw Jason was a brave
young man and did not want him killed.
</p>

<p>
She knew how to help him. She stepped into her carriage, which was
pulled by flying snakes.
</p>

<p>
Then Medea flew through the air. She went to hills and creeks and
picked all kinds of flowers.
</p>

<p>
She took the flowers home and cooked them.
</p>

<p>
Then Medea went to Jason when the king did not know it.
</p>

<p>
She said to Jason, "Rub your face and hands and legs with this juice."
</p>

</p>

<p>
When he did this, he was as strong as a giant.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could hurt him then. Fire could not burn him, and swords
could not cut him.
</p>

<p>
The next day Jason had to plow with the brass bulls and plant the
dragon's teeth.
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning, the king and princess went out to the place.
</p>

<p>
They had good seats where they could see well.
</p>

<p>
All the people in the city came out to see Jason plow.
</p>

<p>
The little boys climbed the trees so they could see better.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason came to the place. The stall where the brass bulls were
tied was not far off.
</p>

<p>
The door was opened and Jason went in.
</p>

<p>
He untied the bulls and took hold of their horns.
</p>

<p>
Then he made the bulls come out of their stall.
</p>



<table summary="stories" width="50%" cellpadding="10" border="1" align="center">

</tbody></table>

<p>
The bulls were very angry and blew fire and smoke from their mouths.
</p>

<p>
This made the cruel king glad. But the people who saw it were afraid.
They did not want Jason killed. They did not know that the princess
had helped him.
</p>

<p>
Jason pushed the bulls' heads down to the ground. Then they kicked at
him with their feet, but could not hurt him.
</p>

<p>
He held their heads down on the ground until the plow was ready.
</p>

<p>
Jason took the chains in one hand. He took the handle of the plow in
the other.
</p>

<p>
The bulls jumped and wanted to run away.
</p>

<p>
But Jason held so hard they had to go very slowly.
</p>

<p>
When it was noon the ground was all plowed.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason let the bulls go.
</p>

<p>
They were so angry that they ran away to the woods.
</p>

<p>
Now Jason went to the king and said, "Give me the dragon's teeth."
</p>

<p>
The king gave him his hat full.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason planted the dragon's teeth, just as a man plants wheat.
</p>

<p>
By this time he was very tired, so he went to lie down.

<p>
In the evening he came back.
</p>

<p>
The iron men were growing up. Some of the men had only their feet in
the ground.
</p>

<p>
Some of them were in the ground up to their knees.
</p>

<p>
Some had only their heads out. They all tried to get out so they could
kill Jason.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason did what Medea told him he should do.
</p>

<p>
He took a giant's marble and threw it near the men.
</p>

<p>
All the iron men wanted to get the marble.
</p>

<p>
So they began to fight each other. As soon as one had his feet out of
the ground, he cut at the man next to him. So they killed each other.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason took his sword and cut off all the heads that were out of
the ground.
</p>

<p>
So all the iron men were killed and the king was very angry.
</p>

<p>
But Medea and the people were glad.

The next day Jason went to the king and said, "Now, give me the
golden fleece."
</p>

<p>
The king did not give it to him, but said, "Come again."
</p>

<p>
Then Medea said, "If you want the golden fleece, you must help
yourself. My father will not give it to you. A dragon is by the tree
where the golden fleece is, and he never sleeps. He is always hungry
and eats people if they go near him. I can not kill him but I can make
him sleep. He is very fond of cake. I will make some cake and put in
something to make the dragon sleep."

So Medea made the cakes and Jason took them and threw them to the
dragon.
</p>

<p>
The dragon ate them all and went to sleep.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason climbed over the dragon and took the nail out of the tree.
</p>

<p>
He put the golden fleece under his coat and ran to the ship Argo.
</p>

<p>
Medea went with him and became his wife.

<p>
Oh, how angry the king was! He had lost the golden fleece and the
brass bulls and the dragon's teeth. And now his daughter was gone.

<p>
At last Medea and Jason and the other Argonauts came to Greece.
</p>

<p>
Jason's father was there. He was a very old man. Jason wanted his
father to be king, so he asked Medea to make the old man young.
</p>

<p>
Then Medea took her carriage and flew through the air.
</p>

<p>
She did not come back for nine days. She picked flowers from the
hills. She found all kinds of stones, too.

<p>
Then she put a stick into the pot and leaves grew on it.
</p>

<p>
Some of the juice fell on the ground and grass grew up.
</p>

<p>
So Medea knew the juice would make things grow.
</p>

<p>
Jason's father went to sleep and Medea put some of the juice into his
mouth.
</p>

<p>
His white hair turned black and teeth grew in his mouth.
</p>

<p>
When he woke up, he looked and felt like a young man.
</p>

<p>
He lived many years and when he died Jason was king.

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Primary Reader, by E. Louise Smythe

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A PRIMARY READER ***

This file should be named 7841-h.htm or 7841-h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, pread11h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, pread10ah.htm

Produced by Juliet Sutherland, Tonya Allen
and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
